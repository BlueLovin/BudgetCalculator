<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is part of a coding challenge submitted to me by a possible future employer. It was done in two days and I had an absolute blast doing it. 

The user is prompted to input a budget. There is a small list of items, pulled from an open Firebase API. You can add those items to your cart. With that, we can determine if the total cost is over, under, or within the user-inputted budget.
